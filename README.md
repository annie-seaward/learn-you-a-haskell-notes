# learn-you-a-haskell-notes
Notes made whilst reading learn you a Haskell for great good by Miran Lipovaca, with exercises from Noel Markham.

Orginal Book used to produce notes: http://learnyouahaskell.com/
Exercises complete from: https://github.com/noelmarkham/learn-you-a-haskell-exercises

The .lhs files are notes from each chapter, with the corrosponing exercises being .hs files. The solution given to the exercises are my own, with the solutions given by Noel Markham often written below, noted by a ' at the end of the function name.
